# RL Module Practicals

##  What I Did
In this practical, I learned how to use **reinforcement learning (RL)** with the **Gymnasium** library.

 Followed a tutorial to set up and run a simple RL agent  
 **Exercise 1:** Looked at the *action space* and *observation space* of the CartPole environment  
 **Exercise 2:** Built a *random agent*, ran it many times, and found the *average reward*  
 Wrote down my results and learning points  

##  Exercise 1: CartPole Environment
 Final Result: **76/100 = 0.76**

##  Challenges
 Understanding what returns (observation, reward, done, info)  
 Writing the loop to run multiple episodes and track rewards correctly  
 Installing Gymnasium and setting everything up  

##  What I Learned
 RL environments are **random**, so results can change each run  
 A random agent performs poorly â†’ shows why strategies are needed  
 The **reward signal** is the key to measuring progress  
 Using **GitHub** helps keep code, results, and notes organized
